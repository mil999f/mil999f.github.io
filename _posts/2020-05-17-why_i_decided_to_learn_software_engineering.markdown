Hi, My name is Milagro or Milly is much easier to pronounce.  A little bit about me: I was born in El Salvador but grew up in South Florida and I like sports, especially soccer.  Alright, enough about that. Now, why did I decided to start this new of journey of studying Software Engineering. 
  Since that first time in high school where they have everyone take a career assessment test, I always came up in the computer technology area as top choice for me.  Computer Programming was always my top match based on what I like.  Since then my curiosity started in computer technology.  I liked playing games and wonder how are they made, what is going on on the background, what makes web pages images move or do certain things.  Due to life situations I did not study Computer Programming but went to General Computing.  
	I been working in technical support and although I like what I do mainly because it has to do with technology. I like the fact that you always half keep on learning as technology keeps on improving.   And finding new and easier ways to accomplish a task or problem is just so fulfilling.
	 Thanks to my friend and Career Karma I started to look into coding and it has raised my curiosity again.  I'm excited to start this new journey but at the same I'm also terrify because everything is completely new to me.  I have been exposed to, let's say the outside of a computer but not in what in going on inside apps, software programs, web pages that we see so coloful and entertaining.   However, I'm more exicited in being able to manipulate and to be able to create my own program, especially a game.
